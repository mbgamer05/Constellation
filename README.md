## How to use

### starting out
when first launched you'll see a login screen please create a username and password and press sign up after that you don't need to sign up again, how great is that!

### Homepage
welcome to the homepage here you can access your board or go to settings, the homepage is still under development so be sure to keep an eye out for change

### Board
welcome to the board the home of the application here is where you can create notes and move them around, how do you do that well simply hold and left click on the note and drag it around! 

want to edit your notes double click on them to pop up the note editing window here you can change the name, preview, and body of the note as well as put a completion data on it!

### settings
ahh every good application has a settings page, while a lot of these buttons don't work be sure to still check out the advanced tab for more feature(like 2 but that's more than 1).

the application comes bundled with three themes off the batt you can select them by clicking on the preview theme buttons!

Make sure to press apply once your settings are done to apply them!
